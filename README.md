# Frontend platforms POCs

June 2020 frontend platform investigations.

The idea of this repo is to investigate and take for a ride (building a little POC in the meantime) some of the current go-to tools and stacks for frontend development.

# Some of the aspects considered are:

- Easy setup and configuration,
- Developer experience,
- Extensions, plugins, and tweaking options available,
- Official support and documentation,
- SSR,
- Number of contributors and commits of the project,
- Latest commits frequency,
- Support for Typescript,
- (etc).

# Contributors

The brains of many people were picked during the process, but the main suspects for this repo are:

- [@matiasherranz](https://github.com/matiasherranz)
- [@martin-eq](https://github.com/martin-eq)
- [@nicolasepiscopo](https://github.com/nicolasepiscopo)
