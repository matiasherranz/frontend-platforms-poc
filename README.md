# Frontend platforms POCs

June 2020 frontend platform investigations.

The idea of this repo is to investigate and take for a ride (building a little POC in the meantime) some of the current go-to tools and stacks for frontend development.

# Some of the aspects considered are:

- Easy setup and configuration,
- Developer experience,
- Extensions, plugins, and tweaking options available,
- Official support and documentation,
- SSR,
- Number of contributors and commits of the project,
- Latest commits frequency,
- Support for Typescript,
- (etc).

# How to use this repo?

Take a look at each of the folders (except from "shared", that has some common code to test the examples). Each one has a Readme with context and instructions:

```bash

├── create-react-app-typescript
├── next.js-with-apollo-app-typescript
